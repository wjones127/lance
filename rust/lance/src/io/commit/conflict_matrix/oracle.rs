//! What *content* a rebase must produce, as opposed to whether it was allowed.
//!
//! The invariants in [`super::invariants`] check that a committed dataset is
//! structurally coherent, and the grid in [`super::cases`] checks the verdict.
//! Neither says anything about the rows. A rebase that produced the right number
//! of structurally valid rows with the wrong values in them passes both, because
//! the only row-count assertion compares a scan against the manifest's own
//! accounting — which is self-referential.
//!
//! This module supplies the missing oracle, and it is stated per isolation
//! level, because "the right content" is exactly what an isolation level defines.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! Under [`Isolation::Serializable`] — which Lance intends to offer, and which
//! does not exist yet — the rule is clean: if `ours` rebases over `theirs` and
//! lands, the result must equal *some* serial execution of the two. Here we
//! check the one serial order a rebase is modelling, `theirs` then `ours`:
//!
//! ```text
//! rebased: fixture -> stage ours -> commit theirs -> commit ours (rebasing)
//! serial:  fixture -> commit theirs -> stage ours -> commit ours (no rebase)
//! ```
//!
//! Under snapshot isolation the rule is weaker, and the difference is the whole
//! point: a transaction may keep values it computed at its read version. A merge
//! insert that decided "this key is absent, so insert" at v2 is entitled to
//! still insert at v4, even though re-running it at v4 would have found the key
//! and updated instead. Serial execution and a correct rebase then legitimately
//! disagree.
//!
//! So the oracle is a serializability check, and the pairs where legacy is
//! weaker than serializable are named in [`EXEMPT`], each with the reason it
//! diverges. That list is not debt to be paid down: it is the measured gap
//! between what legacy does and what `Serializable` would require, which is the
//! input the configurable-isolation work needs. When levels land, each exemption
//! becomes a rule that holds at snapshot and is asserted at serializable.
